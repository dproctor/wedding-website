<h3><a class="anchor" name="outpost" id="outpost"></a>The Stanley Outpost </h3>
The Friday Welcome event and Monday breakfast will both be at the Stanley Outpost. This is also where Caitlin's family is staying, so consider this base camp!

<b>Getting there:</b> Please walk if you're able. It should be just 5 or 10 minutes walking for anyone staying in Stanley. If you're staying outside Stanley, please park along Eva Falls Road.

<b>Directions:</b> The Outpost is along Eva Falls Road (Highway 21) 800 feet west of the Stanley Chamber of Commerce. Look for a driveway and our welcome signs on the north side of the road (creek side, less developed).

<b>Address:</b> 720 Eva Falls Road, Stanley

<h3><a class="anchor" name="redfish" id="redfish"></a>Redfish Lake Picnic Area </h3>
There will be a picnic mid-day Saturday at Redfish Lake North Shore Picnic Area, which will serve as a base for lake activities and hiking. It's right along the lake shore and next to the Marina, and it's 1/3 mile from the Redfish Trailhead. We rented pontoon boats for guests to enjoy from 10 am to 2 pm, and there are SUPs, canoes, and other boats available for rent at the Marina. Meet up promptly at 10 am at the Picnic Area if you are hoping to join a hiking group. Note that you can cut some mileage and get into the peaks faster by taking the boat shuttle from the Marina to land further up trail. We'll have drinks, snacks and lunch food.

<b>Getting there:</b> If you are staying at Triangle C Cabins, Redfish Riverside Inn, or the Stanley High Country Inn, there are free shuttles to the Lake. When you check in, ask for details about timing.

<b>Directions:</b> If you're driving, follow Highway 75 South from town for 4.3 miles. Turn right onto Redfish Lake Road. Follow for 1.2 miles. Take the first exit from the circle to stay on Redfish Lake Road. Continue for 1 mile, bearing left at the fork (to stay on Redfish Lake Road) just before you'll find the Picnic areas on the right. We're at Picnic Area B. There are a few picnic areas, so look for our signs.

<b>Parking:</b> Parking is limited. If there are no remaining spots for our picnic area, additional parking is available at the Redfish Trailhead parking lot 1/3 of a mile back the way you came (on Redfish Lake Road).

<b>Address:</b> Redfish Lake Road, Lowman

<h3><a class="anchor" name="pioneerpark" id="pioneerpark"></a>Pioneer Park </h3>
Our Rehearsal Dinner and Party will be outdoors at Pioneer Park, which is just 1/4 mile up the road from the Stanley Baking Company and feels like it's right up in the Sawtooth peaks. Please note that your invitation listed a different location for this event. The website is your source of truth!

<b>Getting there:</b> Please walk if you're in town and able, or carpool. We will shuttle people up and down the very mild hill between the Stanley Baking Company and the party, though it's an easy walk either way. If you want a ride, hang out just past the bakery where we'll find you.

<b>Directions:</b> Follow Wall Street past the Stanley Baking Company until it turns into Airport Road. Follow Airport Road to a fork. Bear right onto School Road, and youâ€™ll immediately see a small parking pad on your left with a Welcome sign (less than 50 feet from the fork). Follow the path from that pad to the party.

<b>Parking:</b> Follow School Road another 250 feet past the Welcome sign to a parking lot on your left. You'll find the party by following the path past the bathrooms down to the lower part of the park and towards the mountains. (The ballpark should be to your right as you head along the path at the end of the lot.)

<b>Address:</b> Airport Road, Stanley

<h3><a class="anchor" name="cassidys" id="cassidys"></a>The Cassidys' Home </h3>

Our wedding ceremony, dinner reception and dancing will be at the Cassidys' beautiful property along the Salmon River at the site of the historic Salmon River Lodge. (Look out for the Motel sign on the barn across the river from Highway 75.) The ceremony and cocktail hour will be outside. Dinner will be in an open-air tent, and we'll dance in the barn! For warmth, there will be blankets, patio heaters and fires. It should stay warm enough through dinner in the tent, and we'll be in the barn by the time it's dark and cold.

<b>Getting there:</b> There will be a shuttle from downtown Stanley. Check out the map and schedule below. There are about 10 parking spaces right at the shuttle drop-off. Please only use those if we aren't able to pick you up with the shuttle or for any special needs.

<b>Address:</b> 101 Salmon River Lodge Lane, Stanley
