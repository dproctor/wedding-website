<h3> The Stanley Outpost </h3>
The Friday Welcome event and Monday breakfast will both be here. This is also where Caitlin's family is staying, so consider this base camp!

<b>Getting there:</b> Please walk to this event if you're able. It should be very close to anyone staying in Stanley. If you're staying outside Stanley, please park along Eva Falls Road.

The Outpost is along Eva Falls Ave (21) 800 feet west of the Stanley Chamber of Commerce. Look for a driveway and our welcome signs on the north side of the road (creek side, less developed).

<b>Address:</b> 720 Eva Falls Road, Stanley

<h3> Redfish Lake Picnic Area </h3>
We are hosting a picnic mid-day Saturday at Redfish Lake North Shore Picnic Area. It's right next to the lake and the Marina, and 1/3 mile from the Redfish Trailhead for hiking. (You can also cut some mileage and get into the peaks faster by taking the boat shuttle from the Marina further up trail.) We rented pontoon boats for guests to enjoy from 10 am to 2 pm, and there are SUPs, canoes, etc. available for rent at the Marina. Meet up promptly at 10 am at the Picnic Area if you are hoping to join a hiking group. We'll have drinks, snacks and lunch food.

<b>Getting there:</b> If you are staying at Triangle C Cabins, Redfish Riverside Inn, or the Stanley High Country Inn, there are free shuttles to the Lake. When you check in, ask for details about timing.

If you're driving, follow 75 South from town for 4.3 miles. Turn right onto Redfish Lake Road. Follow for 1.2 miles. Take the first exit from the circle to stay on Redfish Lake Road. Continue for 1 mile bearing left at the fork (to stay on Redfish Lake Road) just before you'll find the Picnic areas on the right. We're at Picnic Area B. There are a few picnic areas, so look for our signs.

Parking is limited. If there is no remaining parking for our area, additional parking is available at the Redfish Trailhead parking lot 1/3 of a mile back the way you came (on Redfish Lake Road).

<b>Address:</b> Redfish Lake Road, Lowman

<h3> Pioneer Park </h3>
We are hosting our Rehearsal Dinner and Party at the stunning Pioneer Park. Please note that your invitation listed a different location for this event. The website is your source of truth!

<b>Getting there:</b> Please walk if you're close and able, or carpool. We'll also be shuttling people up and down the very mild hill between the Stanley Baking Co and the party to make it a very short walk. Hang out just past the bakery where we'll see you if you want a ride.

Otherwise, follow Wall Street past the Stanley Baking Company until it turns into Airport Road. Follow Airport Road to a fork. Bear right onto School Road, and you'll immediately see a small parking pad on your left with a Welcome sign (less than 50 feet from the fork). Follow the path from that pad to the party.

For parking, follow School Road another 250 feet to a parking lot on your left. You'll find the party by following the path past the bathrooms down to the lower part of the park and towards the mountains.

<b>Address:</b> Airport Road, Stanley

<h3> The Cassidys' Home </h3>

Our wedding ceremony, dinner reception and dancing will be at the Cassidys' beautiful property along the
Salmon River at the site of the historic Salmon River Lodge. (Look out for the Motel sign on the barn across the river.) The ceremony and cocktail hour will be outside. Dinner will be in heated tent, and we'll dance in the barn!

<b>Getting there:</b> There will be a shuttle from downtown Stanley and nearby areas. Stop times and locations will be posted on this page. There are about 10 parking spaces right at the shuttle drop-off. Please only use those if we aren't able to pick you up with the shuttle or for any special needs.

<b>Address:</b> 101 Salmon River Lodge Lane, Stanley
