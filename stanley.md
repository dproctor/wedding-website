<p>
Stanley is a tiny town (pop. 63) nestled at the foot of
Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains and is a mecca for outdoors
adventures.
</p>
<p>
We’re believers that all the best places are a little off the
beaten path, and Stanley is certainly no exception. It’s going
to take a little effort to get there, but we can’t wait to
share this special place with you. Thank you for making the
trek to join us!
</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="travel" id="travel"></a>Travel</h2>

<h3>Boise Airport</h3>
There will likely be more flight options into Boise than Sun Valley, but the
drive is longer. Budget three hours for this beautiful drive along the
Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway. The roads are well-maintained but winding, and you will lose cell service shortly after leaving Boise. Stop in at Kirkham Hot Springs just off the road when you’re two hours into the drive and ready to officially enter vacation mode. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NbSeASAKaRNdaCmc8">Directions (includes the Hot Springs)</a>.

Alternatively, you can <a href="https://gemairflights.com/middle-fork-round-trip/">take Gem Air for a scenic prop plane flight</a>, which will drop you right in Stanley, just a few minutes walk from our rehearsal party site at Pioneer Park. It's usually $190 per person each way, but you'll need to reach out to confirm availability.

<h3>Sun Valley (Friedman Memorial Airport)</h3>

Plan for the drive to take a little over an hour. You’ll take Highway 75
through the Sawtooth National Forest and along stunning views of the Sawtooth
Mountains. Look out for pronghorn antelope, mountain goats and sandhill cranes.
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/r7sHLQZAxTxUJtHA8">Directions</a>.

<h3>Salt Lake City</h3>
If you are having trouble finding direct flights to Boise or Sun Valley, Salt Lake City is a third option with a longer drive (~5.5 hours).

<h3>Driving</h3>
Coming into Stanley from any direction, we recommend that you avoid driving at night. There is
beautiful scenery you won’t want to miss, and the combination of windy dark
roads and wildlife (tons of elk) can be dangerous. If you land in Sun Valley or Boise Friday
evening, you might want to spend the night there and drive in the morning. Also note that you will lose cell service shortly after leaving both Boise and Ketchum, so load the directions and some entertainment before you take off.

<h3>Carpooling</h3>
Once you're in Stanley, all events except the Saturday daytime activities at Redfish Lake
will be walkable from downtown Stanley, or we'll provide a shuttle. If you want to carpool
from either airport to and from Stanley, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hy1C855XqIJmze7v1AY5gXepYEa5bNNv6iTHWWC0ah4/edit?usp=sharing">you can use this spreadsheet to coordinate rides with other guests</a>.

<h2> <a class="anchor" name="where-to-stay" id="where-to-stay"></a>Where to stay </h2>
Book early! Stanley is a very popular summer destination, and we expect that to be especially the case for Labor Day Weekend in 2021. Several places are already full, so book fast if you don’t want to wind up in a tent!

<h3><a name="mountain-village" id="mountain village"   href="https://www.mountainvillage.com/">Mountain Village Resort</a></h3>

<h3><a name="lower-stanley-cabins" id="lower-stanley-cabins"> Lower Stanley Cabins</a></h3>

<em>Update: A few rooms and cabins available.</em> There are two fairly rustic cabin options in Lower Stanley, just about 1.5 miles from Stanley. This is close but not walkable like most of the options. These cabins are affordable options set right along the river with stunning mountain views. There are a variety of cabin options.

<h2> <a class="anchor" name="weather" id="weather"></a>Weather </h2>
<p>
Fun fact: Stanley is the coldest place in the continental United States, as measured by low temperature at night. You’re probably thinking that’s not so fun since you’ve been invited to an outdoor wedding. Don’t worry! The weather will be gorgeous during the day, cool in the evening, and only cold around 9PM and on. For the wedding reception, we’ll be in the barn by the time it gets cold. On the Friday and Saturday events, we’ll gather around cozy fires and patio heaters with blankets, but definitely wear a coat!

<h3>Biking</h3>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/mtb.jpg">

<p>
There are awesome mountain biking trails near Stanley. <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/5893349/fisher-creek-loop">Fisher
Creek Loop</a> and <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7028598/elk-mountain-loop">Elk
Mountain Loop</a> are two great less technical (intermediate)
options, and <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7008401/dry-creek-road-630">Dry
Creek Road</a> is a good beginner option. <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7011749/potato-mountain-ride">Potato
Mountain</a> is a great advanced option. You can find more mtb info at <a href="https://stanleycc.org/Blogs/ArticleID/480/mountainbiking">An Insider's Guide to the Mountain Biking in Stanley, Idaho: Some of the Best Riding in the West</a> and <a href="https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8011473/sawtooth-national-recreation-area">MTB Project</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you’d really like to turn your time out west into an
adventure, consider the <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/idaho-hot-springs-mountain-bike-route/">Idaho Hot Springs Mountain Bike Route</a>.
We’ve had this on our list since the route was published, and
a friend completed and highly recommended it. It’s more gravel
and 4WD roads than technical mountain biking, though there are
singletrack options.
</p>

<p>
Bike rentals are available through <a href="">River wear</a> or <a href="">Sawtooth Adventure at the Adventure Hut</a> at Redfish Lodge, which also offers <a href="">guided mountain bike rides</a>.
<h3>Whitewater rafting</h3>
Stanley sits at the headwaters of the Salmon River providing
access to world-class rapids. There are popular
family-friendly options for day trips on rafts or kayaks all
the way up to six day trips with Class IV rapids through
stunning backcountry. Find river guides <a href="https://stanleycc.org/Do/River-Rafting">here</a>.

<h3>Redfish lake</h3>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/redfish.png">
If whitewater sounds a little too adventurous, there are
plenty of other water activities available at <a
href="https://redfishlake.com/marina/">Redfish Marina</a>:
stand up paddleboards (and a 7 person SUP?!), kayaks, canoes,
pontoon boats, and boat tours.

<h3>Hot Springs</h3>
<ul>

<a href="https://www.mountainvillage.com/hot-springs/">Mountain Village Hot Springs</a> is right in Stanley, and requires reservations.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/hot_springs.png">
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sun Valley</h3>
If you’ve never been, consider spending a few days in Ketchum
on either end of the wedding. It’s a classy Western resort
town with plenty of vacation-worthy lodges, hotels and
restaurants.

<h2> <a class="anchor" name="packing-tips" id="packing-tips"></a>Packing tips </h2>
<p>
Here are a few things you may want to pack for your visit.
<ul>
 <li> Party clothes! See the <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> for dress codes for the events. All events will be outdoors on grass, so pack sensible shoes. (Even the bride is wearing block heels!)</li>
 <li> A swimsuit and towel. Bring something you don't mind wearing in natural hot springs, rivers and lakes. </li>
  <li> Chacos, Tevas or any sandles or shoes you can wear in rivers. </li>
 <li> Hiking clothes and shoes. </li>
 <li> A warm coat. Even on hot days, when the sun drops, you will want to grab your puffer. You'll also want it for the chilly mornings. Take another  look at the <a href="#weather"> weather</a>. </li>
 <li> A water bottle. Stanley is at 6,200 feet elevation, so it's important to stay hydrated. </li>
 <li> Sun protection. This will be a weekend of the outdoors, so sun protection is always a good idea. We'll provide sunscreen, but pack your hats, sunglasses, sleeves.</li>
 <li> A headlight is a good idea if you want to take post-sunset hot springs soaks. </li>
 <li> If you need any specific groceries for your visit, you'll want to pack them in your suitcase or pick up in Boise or Ketchum (Sun Valley). Stanley is a small mountain town, and the grocery stores are a bit lacking. You'll find the basics, and not a lot more. (You'll find more than enough delicious food to eat at the restaurants though, so don't worry!)</li>
</ul>
</p>
