<p>
Stanley is a tiny town (pop. 63) nestled at the foot of
Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains and is a mecca for outdoors
adventures.
</p>
<p>
We’re believers that all the best places are a little off the
beaten path, and Stanley is certainly no exception. It’s going
to take a little effort to get there, but we can’t wait to
share this special place with you. Thank you for making the
trek to join us!
</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="travel" id="travel"></a>Travel</h2>

<h3>Boise Airport</h3>
There will likely be more flight options into Boise than Sun Valley, but the
drive is longer. Budget three hours for this beautiful drive along the
Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway. The roads are well-maintained but winding. Stop in
at Kirkham Hot Springs just off the road when you’re two hours into the drive
and ready to officially enter vacation mode. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NbSeASAKaRNdaCmc8">Directions (includes the Hot Springs)</a>.

<h3>Sun Valley (Friedman Memorial Airport)</h3>

Plan for the drive to take a little over an hour. You’ll take Highway 75
through the Sawtooth National Forest and along stunning views of the Sawtooth
Mountains. Look out for pronghorn antelope, mountain goats and sandhill cranes.
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/r7sHLQZAxTxUJtHA8">Directions</a>.

From either airport, we recommend that you avoid driving at night. There is
beautiful scenery you won’t want to miss, and the combination of windy dark
roads and wildlife can be dangerous. If you land in Sun Valley or Boise Friday
evening, you might want to spend the night there and drive in the morning.

<h2> <a class="anchor" name="where-to-stay" id="where-to-stay"></a>Where to stay </h2>
Book early! Stanley is a very popular summer destination, and we expect that to
be especially the case for Labor Day Weekend in 2021. There are already a couple
places that are full, so book fast if you don’t want to wind up in a tent!

Read our guide below or use this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1_B3vhMWHFdH3K45NLqSttNAF5bBIlxmC&usp=sharing">interactive map</a> to pick a spot.

<h3><a name="triangle-c-cabins" id="triangle-c-cabins"  href="https://triangleccabins.com/">Triangle C Cabins</a></h3>

These standalone cabins are cozy, a little rustic and very popular. Enjoy the
firepit in the evenings and volleyball, bocce and other games on-site. Expect
this site to be packed with other wedding guests. As part of Redfish Resort,
free shuttles to stunning Redfish Lake are a perk of staying here.

<h3><a name="danners-log-cabins" id="danners-log-cabins"   href="http://www.dannerslogcabins.com/">Danner’s Log Cabins</a></h3>
These log cabins are a favorite for weddings in Stanley.
Expect them to be packed with other wedding guests. These
simple but cozy cabins began as one of Idaho's first Ranger

<h3><a name="idaho-rocky-mountain-ranch" id="idaho-rocky-mountain-ranch"   href="https://idahorocky.com/">Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch</a></h3>

<h3><a name="redfish-lake-lodge" id="redfish-lake-lodge"   href="https://redfishlake.com/">Redfish Lake Lodge</a></h3>
Set next to crystal clear Redfish Lake and with stunning Sawtooth Mountain views, this resort is the most popular spot in the area. If you can find a room, snag it. It’s about a 10-minute drive from Stanley and the wedding venue. Whether or not you stay here, we recommend visiting Redfish Lake during your stay. If you stay at Triangle C Cabins or the Redfish Riverside Inn, there are free shuttles to the Lake.

<h3>Biking</h3>

<p>
There are awesome mountain biking trails near Stanley. <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/5893349/fisher-creek-loop">Fisher
Creek Loop</a> and <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7028598/elk-mountain-loop">Elk
Mountain Loop</a> are two great less technical (intermediate)
options, and <a
href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7008401/dry-creek-road-630">Dry

<p>
If you’d really like to turn your time out west into an
adventure, consider the <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/idaho-hot-springs-mountain-bike-route/">Idaho Hot Springs Mountain Bike Route</a>.
We’ve had this on our list since the route was published, and
a friend completed and highly recommended it. It’s more gravel
and 4WD roads than technical mountain biking, though there are
singletrack options.
</p>

<p>
Bike rentals are available through <a href="">River wear</a> or <a href="">Sawtooth Adventure at the Adventure Hut</a> at Redfish Lodge, which also offers <a href="">guided mountain bike rides</a>.
<h3>Whitewater rafting</h3>
Stanley sits at the headwaters of the Salmon River providing
access to world-class rapids. There are popular
family-friendly options for day trips on rafts or kayaks all
the way up to six day trips with Class IV rapids through
stunning backcountry. Find river guides <a href="https://stanleycc.org/Do/River-Rafting">here</a>.

<h3>Redfish lake</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/redfish.png">
If whitewater sounds a little too adventurous, there are
plenty of other water activities available at <a
href="https://redfishlake.com/marina/">Redfish Marina</a>:
stand up paddleboards (and a 7 person SUP?!), kayaks, canoes,
pontoon boats, and boat tours.

<h3>Hot Springs</h3>

on either end of the wedding. It’s a classy Western resort
town with plenty of vacation-worthy lodges, hotels and
restaurants.
